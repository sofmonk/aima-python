    "1. **STRIPS** \n",
    "The simplest language used for formalizing actions is the STRIPS language. In STRIPS, the state variables have the domain {0,1} (equivalently {FALSE, TRUE}), and an action consists of three sets of state variables, the PRECONDITION, the ADD={a1,a2,...,an} list, and the DELETE={d1,d2,...,dm} list (it is assumed that ADD and DELETE don't intersect.) \n",

    "3. **PDDL**\n",
    "(\"Planning Domain Definition Language\") is a recent atempt to standardize planning domain and problem description languages. It was developed mainly to make the 1998/2000 International Planning Competitions possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The differences of PDDL in comparison to STRIPS are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The PRECONDITION may be an arbitrary Boolean combination of atomic facts about the state variables. Atomic facts say something about one state variable, for example a=0 or b=1. A precondition could for example be (a=1)∨¬(b=1∧c=0).\n",
    "  - Instead of the unconditional assignments represented by ADD and DELETE, the effects may be conditional. This means that the effects are of the form, IF condition THEN a := v where the condition is a Boolean combination of facts. STRIPS corresponds to PDDL with trivial conditions that are always true (the condition is the constant TRUE).\n",
